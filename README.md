# Konsole.js

Konsole.js is a On-Screen Debugger/Logger and (optionally)
default browser console replacement for mobile and desktop.

Konsole was created to have a quick and simple way to debug a 
project you are working on, without the need to have a debugger take
up precious space. Konsole can be quickly accessed and used
via Keyboard shortcuts. If you want to open Konsole on mobile, there
is a hidden square/button at the bottom right of the browser on mobile devices.

Here, have a [demo](https://rawgit.com/eatcodeplay/Konsole.js/master/examples/basic.html).


## Features

* Mobile Friendly. Can be opened via a hidden square/button at the bottom right of any mobile browser.
* Obviously logging ( Log types: `log, info, system, warn, error, event` ).
* Prettifies log output, also allowing to define custom inspection depth 
* Takeover-Mode: use Konsole as if it were `console`. (Can be disabled)
* Create custom commands that can be called via the Commandline.
* Monitor values via a floating Window. Useful for fast changing properties.
* `Object.observe` in Konsole. Loads Polyfill (using [MaxArt2501/object-observe](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/object-observe)) if neccessary.
* Display FPS/MS Stats via [mrdoob/stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/).
* Find / Highlight DOM Elements.
* Display DOM Elements in Konsole.
* A simple DOM Overflow Tester ( no success-guarantee given ;) ).
* CSS Manipulation ( add/remove classes, change properties, retrieve styles on DOM Element ).
* Possibility to log to a server via KonsoleReport. 


## How-to use

Konsole currently requires `jQuery v1` or `jQuery v2` to be loaded before itself.
Afterwards just add the CSS and Javascript File and you are good to go.

```html
    <!-- Make sure you've loaded jQuery before -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="konsole-1.2.0.bundled.min.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="konsole-1.2.0.bundled.min.js"></script>


    <!-- ready to go -->
    <script>
        console.log('hello world');
    </script>
```

Konsole comes in two flavors:

* `bundled` with [prettify.js](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for DOM Element beautifying.
* regular `min` in case you don't need/want that.
* use `nokonsole` to disable logging without the need to remove any logging code.
* The same thing can be achieved by setting the option `Konsole.enabled` to `false`.

## Documentation

* Check out the [JSDocs](https://rawgit.com/eatcodeplay/Konsole.js/master/docs/index.html) for a Method and Property Reference.
* There are simple examples on how to use Konsole in the `/examples` folder. [Basic Example](https://rawgit.com/eatcodeplay/Konsole.js/master/examples/basic.html) , [Options Example](https://rawgit.com/eatcodeplay/Konsole.js/master/examples/options.html)
* For a list of available commands type `help` in the Konsole commandline.


## KonsoleReport

KonsoleReport is a small PHP Backend for Konsole to send messages to. It requires
PHP 5+ and writes its logs as JSON Files (one for each day).

Check out the [JSDocs](https://rawgit.com/eatcodeplay/Konsole.js/master/docs/index.html) on how to use it.

More Documentation will be added soon hopefully :)

## Browser Support

* Any modern Desktop or Mobile Browser and IE9 upwards
* IE8 requires `jQuery v1`. No guarantees given that everything works smoothly :P
